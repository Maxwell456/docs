##  How Adaptive-Link Works  

Wireless communication can transmit data at high speeds over short distances with a strong signal, or slowly but over longer distances with a weaker signal.  

OpenIPC allows you to choose one fixed link speed and video bitrate. Default:  
- **Bitrate:** 4 Mbps  
- **Channel Width:** 20 MHz  
- **MCS:** 1  
- **FEC:** 8/12  
- **Guard Interval:** long  

This is a "universal" profile — moderate quality and average range.

**Adaptive-Link** solves this by automatically selecting the best link and video profile based on signal quality (RSSI and SNR).  

Strong signal = high speed and quality  
Weak signal = long-range profile and lower bitrate  

---

##  How It Works  

- **On the Ground Station**, `alink_gs` monitors RSSI and SNR, calculates a final "score" (1000–2000), and sends it to the drone.  
- **On the drone**, `alink_drone` receives the score and selects the appropriate profile from `/etc/txprofiles.conf`.  
- Profile transitions are controlled via `/etc/alink.conf`.

### Example:  
```ini
rssi_min = -80  
rssi_max = -40  
snr_min = 12  
snr_max = 36  
```

If RSSI = -60 and SNR = 20:  
- RSSI score = 1500  
- SNR score = 1333  
- Final score (with 0.5/0.5 weights) ≈ 1416  
- `alink` selects profile: `1051 - 1500`

## Example Configurations  

### `/etc/txprofiles.conf`  
```bash
999 - 999 long 0 8 12 1999 10 30 0,0,0,0 20 -12
1000 - 1050 long 0 8 12 2000 10 30 0,0,0,0 20 -12
1051 - 1500 long 1 8 12 4000 10 25 0,0,0,0 20 -12
1501 - 1950 long 2 8 12 8000 10 20 12,6,6,12 20 -12
1951 - 2001 short 2 8 12 9000 10 20 12,6,6,12 20 -12
```

 :::caution
   Set the transmission power levels in `/etc/txprofiles.conf` carefully. The default is `30`, which is safe for most adapters but may be too low for some. Adjust the power accordingly to ensure optimal performance.

### `/etc/alink.conf`  
```ini
rssi_weight=0.3  
snr_weight=0.7  
fallback_ms=1000  
hold_fallback_mode_s=3  
min_between_changes_ms=150  
hold_modes_down_s=4  
hysteresis_percent=15  
```

## Installation  

:::tip 
**An internet connection is required.**
:::
### On Drone (OpenIPC)  
```bash
cd /etc
curl -L -o alink_install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenIPC/adaptive-link/refs/heads/main/alink_install.sh
chmod +x alink_install.sh
./alink_install.sh drone install
reboot
```

Add to autostart:
```bash
/etc/rc.local >>  alink_drone & 
```

### On Ground Station (Radxa / Android / PC)  
```bash
sudo curl -L -o alink_install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenIPC/adaptive-link/refs/heads/main/alink_install.sh
sudo chmod +x alink_install.sh
sudo ./alink_install.sh gs install
```

**Config will be located at:**  
- `/config/alink_gs.conf`, or  
- `/home/radxa/alink_gs.conf`, or  
- `/etc/alink_gs.conf`

## Troubleshooting

### If the drone stays in long-range mode (profile 999), check:

- Ground station transmitter power
- Antenna connections
- `/etc/txprofiles.conf` settings

### If the video quality is poor despite a strong signal:

- Check bitrate settings in `/etc/txprofiles.conf`
- Ensure RSSI and SNR weights in `/etc/alink.conf` are set correctly

### If the system frequently changes settings:

- Increase `min_between_changes_ms` value in `/etc/alink.conf`
- Increase `hysteresis_percent` value in `/etc/alink.conf`

## Parameters

| Parameter | Full Name | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **RSSI** | Received Signal Strength Indicator | The power level of the received wireless signal. Measured in dBm, with values closer to 0 indicating a stronger signal. |
| **SNR** | Signal-to-Noise Ratio | The ratio of signal power to noise power. Higher values indicate better signal quality and cleaner transmission. |
| **MCS** | Modulation and Coding Scheme | Determines the data transfer rate by defining how information is encoded for transmission over the wireless medium. |
| **FEC** | Forward Error Correction | A technique that adds redundant data to transmissions, allowing the receiver to detect and correct errors without retransmission. |
| **GOP** | Group of Pictures | Defines the sequence and organization of video frames between keyframes. Affects video compression efficiency and stream responsiveness. |
| **Bitrate** | Amount of video data per second | The quantity of data used per second of video, typically measured in Mbps. Higher bitrates generally provide better image quality at the cost of increased bandwidth usage. |

## Recommendations  

- Don’t choose profiles with high bitrate if your system can’t handle the traffic.  
- Always tailor `txprofiles.conf` to your adapter — especially **power levels**.
